# Status_Deck_HackPad
Status_Deck is a fully custom-designed macro pad developed using the Seeed XIAO RP2040 microcontroller. The device incorporates a 2×3 diode-isolated key matrix, dual rotary encoders, and an I²C OLED display to provide real-time user feedback. The buttons are programmable to your needs, and this project was made for easy day-to-day use.
